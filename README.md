This Tribute Page comprises HTML for the overall structure and CSS for styling. The HTML file includes metadata, a page title, and links to an external CSS file for styling. The body contains a header with a navigation bar linking to different sections of the page, such as Introduction, Early Career, Captaincy, Achievements, and Legacy. Each section features an image and descriptive text detailing various aspects of Dhoni's life and career. The page also includes a footer with a tribute message. The external CSS file styles the overall page with a linear gradient background, a sticky header with animation, and responsive section layouts. The CSS further defines styles for headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation links, and images, with additional animations for visual effects. The use of keyframes and transitions enhances the user experience with smooth animations and interactive hover effects. Together, these files create a visually appealing Tribute page to MS Dhoni.
